# Deploy nmon

In order to install nmon and the Axibase sender script on multiple Linux machines use the nmon_deploy.sh script.

The nmon_deploy.sh script will execute the following steps on each specified target machine:


- connect to remote machine over ssh
- copy nmon binary file
- copy atsd sender script
- add a cron task to restart nmon data collection on a schedule


Get the latest nmon files, [nmon_deploy.sh](https://github.com/axibase/nmon/blob/master/nmon_deploy.sh) and sender script from our GitHub: [https://github.com/axibase/nmon](https://github.com/axibase/nmon)

nmon_deploy.sh accepts the following flags:

| Flag | Description | 
| === | === | 
| -c | set path to deploy.properties file, that contains all the configurations required by nmon_deploy.sh script. | 
| -n | does not modify cron, only updates nmon binary file and ATSD sender script. Useful to update nmon or sender script to a new version. | 
| -d | comments out all nmon cron tasks, will stop nmon data collection and sending to ATSD | 
| -i | while nmon does have any dependencies, the ATSD sender script has the following dependencies: crontab, telnet. With -i flag the script will only check and install dependencies. Requires sudo credentials defined in deploy.properties file. After installing the dependencies, run the script again without the -i flag to install nmon and sender script. | 


The deploy.properties file contains the target machine parameters, user details, path to nmon and crontab settings:

Use hashtags # to comment out optional parameters.

The following files must be located in the same directory as the nmon_deploy.sh script (path to files is set in deploy.properties file):


- nmon binary file
- sender script
- target machine user ssh key
- atsdreadonly ssh key


| Setting | Description | 
| === | === | 
| nmon.s | pause between nmon snapshots | 
| nmon.c | nmon snapshot count | 
| nmon.cron.hour | cron task start hour | 
| nmon.cron.minute | cron task start minute | 
| atsd.protocol | data transfer protocol that will be used. Possible values: telnet, ssh | 
| atsd.port | ATSD port that will receive the nmon data | 
| atsd.key | path to ssh key for readonly account. id_rsa_atsdreadonly by default. Optional parameter | 
| atsd.user | readonly user account. atsdreadonly by default. Optional parameter | 
| atsd.hostname | ATSD server that will store the nmon data | 
| deploy.user | user of target machines | 
| deploy.key | path to ssh key to access target machines by the user set in deploy.user | 
| deploy.password | password of target machine user set in deploy.user setting. Password takes priority over ssh key. | 
| deploy.sudo.user | sudo user of target machines. Optional parameter | 
| deploy.sudo.key | path to sudo users ssh key to access target machines. Optional parameter. | 
| deploy.sudo.password | password of target machine sudo user set in deploy.sudo.user setting. Password takes priority over ssh key. Optional Parameter. | 
| deploy.nmon-binary | path to nmon binary file that will be installed on target machines. | 
| deploy.directory | directory that will be used on target machines to install nmon and the sender script. The user must have write access to this directory. | 
| deploy.target | target server hostname or ip address and ssh connection port separated by : Can be set to multiple servers, one server per line. | 


Example deploy.properties file:

Once the deploy.properties file is setup and paths to the required files are set, deploy nmon and the sender script to remote target machines:

The script will check each machine for dependencies and show installation progress/results on screen.
